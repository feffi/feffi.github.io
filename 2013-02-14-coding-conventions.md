The following post is not meant to be [religious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster "Flying Spaghetti Monster"):

The [Gang of Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns "Design Patterns") gave us wisdom, praying down a pour set of rule we should recommend to everyone:

- [do not use abbreviations](http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html)!
- write your code readable for everyone (this will even help you to understand it yourself)
- always use [getter/setter](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=92) methods
- getter and setter alway stay together
- use [<span class="lang:java decode:true crayon-inline ">final</span>](http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/tips/final.shtml)
- user comments! describe **what** you do, not **how** you do it
- [test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) your code
- **test** your code *twice*
- **test** your code a *third* time, even if you think, itâ€™s not neccessary
- you can write bad code in **every** programming language
- use [tabs instead of spaces](http://xahlee.org/UnixResource_dir/writ/tabs_vs_spaces.html) for indentation
- !(difficult code is difficult to read)
- always use [PMD](http://pmd.sourceforge.net)
- use [checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net)
- you should use [Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net) for your [coverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage)
- test your [GUI](http://seleniumhq.org)
- mangle your code through [HTTPUnit](http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/), [jUnit](http://www.junit.org) and [DBUnit](http://www.dbunit.org)
- you should have read - [Whatever happened to programming?](http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/03/03/whatever-happened-to-programming/)
- [Whatever happened to programming, redux: it may not be as bad as all that](http://reprog.wordpress.com/2010/03/04/whatever-happened-to-programming-redux-it-may-not-be-as-bad-as-all-that/)
- start [counting by zero](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html)
- use no umlauts
- you need to know [regex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regex) and [understand](http://www.regular-expressions.info) it, even in [java](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html)
- and there was [UTF-8](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) and [it was good](http://developers.sun.com/dev/gadc/technicalpublications/articles/utf8.html)
