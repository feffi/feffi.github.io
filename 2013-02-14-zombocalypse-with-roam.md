A new **Zombokalypse!!!** is approaching. A single player and coop-mode zombie-style survival game. It already started as a [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roam/roam) project: [ROAM](http://www.roam-game.com/)

It has a full fledged *generic generated world with NPCs and various events,*

and fine grained *base constructing* for all your survival needs. Based on the money driven by kickstarter, even a *full destroyable world* maybe in pack.

Between **october and december 2013** a beta release is planned. Official release date is somewhere in **january 2014.**
