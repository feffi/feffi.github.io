*Ahead is an acticle some colleagues and me wrote a couple of weeks ago. *

The initial hype about ***service-oriented architecture (SOA)*** is over, and it seems that it is not the next revolutionary step after centralized architectures. On the other hand, the paradigm may still be of use for *financial services institutions (FSIs)*.

Lack of consequence in some recent *SOA implementations* should not disqualify the paradigm, but instead we should look at lessons learned and create better architecture blueprints for future transformation projects. So from a business perspective of typical FSIs – mainly banks, asset management, hedge funds or insurance companies with considerable amount of capital markets activities – we want to see how the *SOA paradigm* can be applied to*reap benefits*.

Academia has made some progress, proposing “*emergent virtual enterprises*” based on service-oriented architecture. Rapid project or merger-driven assembly of whole legal entities is a truly tempting scenario. However, we will stay focused on the practical aspects, i.e., how SOA applies to FSI landscapes and how ***data as a service (DaaS)*** can take place to increase the ability to manage IT complexity.

Our reflection starts with typical business requirements and metrics for business decisions – the starting point for design and planning of *architecture transformation*. As system environment change leads, with rare exceptions, to significant transformation costs, we want to point out reasons for transforming traditional data distribution topologies towards SOAdominated infrastructures.
