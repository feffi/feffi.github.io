Always wanted to boot macOS in Verbose Mode? To turn on Verbose booting, at the Terminal type the following:
```
$ sudo nvram boot-args=”-v”
```
Disabling Verbose booting is just as easy:
```
$ sudo nvram boot-args=
```
If you’re curious what the current firmware nvram settings are, type the following:
```
$ nvram -p
```
